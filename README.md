# How to use Product Fruits with Angular

Check the src/app/app.component.ts file. It contains the Product Fruits snippet.

In the Installation section, copy and paste the JS snippet to a place where your Angular application is initialized. If you use Angular Router, DO NOT insert the snippet to every route. Insert it outside of the router. Product Fruits MUST be initialized only once per application.
